//! Grid operator kind validation: CRD install, operator launch, and

//!
//! These helpers target a **local, out-of-cluster** operator run — the
//! operator binary is spawned as a subprocess using the current kubeconfig
//! context, so no container image build or push is required.
//!
//! Validation sequence:
//! 1. Install Grid CRDs via `generate_crds` binary piped to `kubectl apply`.
//! 2. Apply test `GridNetwork` and `InferenceProvider` fixtures.
//! 3. Spawn operator (`cargo run -p operator`) in the background.
//! 4. Poll provider status until reconciled (up to 60 s).
//! 5. Read the generated routing overlay `ConfigMap` and verify contents.
//! 6. Kill the operator process.
