# Provider Scoring

For how scoring interacts with routing policy, selection groups, and request-time
selection, see the [AGN Routing Guide](../routing.md). This page covers metric
inputs, normalization, and the provider scoring implementation.

AGN scores provider pools when the operator renders a Praxis routing overlay.
Praxis reads that overlay from memory at request time; it does not call AGN,
Kubernetes, the operator, or an EPP metrics endpoint on the request path.

## Responsibility Boundary

AGN and llm-d make different decisions:

```text
AGN Operator (before the request)
  EPP pool metrics -> select and score a provider pool -> routing overlay

Praxis edge (during the request)
  local overlay -> select an eligible provider gateway

llm-d EPP (inside the selected provider)
  request + endpoint state -> select an inference pod
```

AGN uses provider-level telemetry that can be collected asynchronously. llm-d
EPP can additionally use request-specific information, such as how much of the
current prompt prefix is cached on each pod.

AGN therefore does not offer a `prefixAware` scoring strategy. A pool-average
KV-cache utilization metric measures capacity pressure; it does not prove that
the current request's prefix is cached. Prefix affinity belongs in EPP.

## Configuration

`GridNetwork.spec.scoringPolicy.strategy` selects one provider-level strategy.
This follows llm-d's independent-scorer model without exposing a plugin system
or an arbitrary matrix of weights in the `GridNetwork` API.

When `scoringPolicy` is present, `strategy` is required. Omit the entire
`scoringPolicy` object to use the `noMetrics` default. This also makes manifests
using the removed `profile`/`weights` shape fail admission instead of silently
falling back to another strategy.

### No metrics (default)

```yaml
apiVersion: grid.praxis.fast/v1alpha1
kind: GridNetwork
metadata:
  name: production
spec:
  scoringPolicy:
    strategy: noMetrics
```

Omitting `scoringPolicy` has the same effect. Every admitted candidate receives
zero dynamic score. "No metrics" does not mean "no policy": health, admission,
freshness, model compatibility, geography, selection tiers, session affinity,
and Praxis selection policy continue to apply.

Use this strategy for heterogeneous grids, external APIs such as OpenAI,
Anthropic, or Bedrock, and providers that do not expose comparable pool
telemetry. Equivalent providers can participate in the same Praxis selection
group without an unavailable metric creating an artificial preference.

### Queue depth

```yaml
apiVersion: grid.praxis.fast/v1alpha1
kind: GridNetwork
metadata:
  name: production
spec:
  routingPolicy: scoreFirst
  scoringPolicy:
    strategy: queueDepth
```

The operator prefers the provider with the shortest normalized queue:

```text
score = 1 - normalized_queue_depth
```

This corresponds to the intent of llm-d's `queue-scorer`. AGN normalizes an
EPP pool-average queue count using `metricsConfig.queueCapacity` and clamps the
result to `0.0..1.0`.

### KV-cache pressure

```yaml
spec:
  routingPolicy: scoreFirst
  scoringPolicy:
    strategy: kvCachePressure
```

The operator prefers the provider with the most available KV-cache capacity:

```text
score = 1 - kv_cache_utilization
```

This corresponds to llm-d's `kv-cache-utilization-scorer`. Lower utilization
scores higher. This strategy is about available capacity, not cache affinity.

## Why Strategies Are Not Combined

Queue depth and KV-cache pressure describe different operating objectives. A
weighted sum can hide which condition caused a provider to win and can produce
surprising crossover points. AGN keeps the normal configuration explicit: use
`noMetrics`, or choose the single signal that represents the deployment's
provider-selection goal.

llm-d supports weighted scorer composition because it performs fine-grained,
per-request endpoint scheduling. AGN deliberately exposes less complexity at
the cross-site provider layer. New strategies should be added only when AGN
has a real provider-level signal with defined freshness and normalization.

## Metrics Configuration

`InferenceProvider.spec.metricsConfig` enables Prometheus text-format scraping.
Use `metricsEndpoint` when metrics are exposed by an llm-d EPP service rather
than the inference endpoint:

The signal names below are illustrative. Match them to the deployed exporter's
`/metrics` output and pool labels; scheduler versions and adapters can expose
different names. They are not guaranteed defaults for every llm-d deployment.

```yaml
spec:
  endpoint: http://inference-pool.inference.svc:8000
  metricsConfig:
    metricsEndpoint: http://llmd-epp-metrics.inference.svc:9090
    path: /metrics
    timeout: 2s
    poolName: llama-70b-east
    queueCapacity: 64
    staleMetricsSeconds: 30
    signalNames:
      queueDepth: inference_pool_average_queue_size
      kvCacheUtilization: inference_pool_average_kv_cache_utilization
      healthy: inference_pool_ready_pods
```

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `metricsEndpoint` | Optional base URL for a dedicated metrics service. |
| `path` | Metrics path, default `/metrics`. |
| `timeout` | Per-scrape timeout. |
| `poolName` | Selects samples for the intended EPP pool. |
| `queueCapacity` | Normalizes an absolute queue count to `0.0..1.0`. |
| `signalNames` | Maps AGN signals to exporter metric names. |
| `staleMetricsSeconds` | Grace period for reusing the last successful local scrape. |

One `InferenceProvider` represents a schedulable pool. AGN does not rank the
individual vLLM pods in that pool.

## Missing and Stale Metrics

NaN and infinite samples are discarded. Ratio values received through remote
state are clamped before scoring. A local scrape failure may reuse the last
successful sample while it remains within `staleMetricsSeconds`.

A provider with no live metrics and no effective metrics TLS currently falls
back to neutral signal values (0.5 for ratio signals, `healthy = true`). This
compatibility behavior means a provider with missing telemetry can score
competitively with a provider under real pressure. For a provider configured
with `spec.tls` or a `metricsConfig.tls` override, a failed scrape can reuse a
successful sample only within `staleMetricsSeconds`; after that, AGN marks the
provider unhealthy so it is excluded from routing. Production deployments using `queueDepth` or
`kvCachePressure` should ensure every competing provider exposes fresh,
comparable telemetry for the selected signal. `noMetrics` does not require a
metrics endpoint.

## Current Limits

- No request-specific prefix affinity at the AGN layer.
- No independent remote metric sample timestamp yet.
- Stabilized admission is available through `spec.admissionPolicy`; it uses
  bounded pressure/recovery counters and hold-down timers, while omitting the
  field preserves instantaneous compatibility behavior.
- Ranking still has no independent score-switch margin or dwell timer; that is
  separate from provider admission and remains future work.
- Queue normalization depends on a correct `queueCapacity`.
- A network-wide metric strategy is appropriate only when competing providers
  expose comparable telemetry; use `noMetrics` for heterogeneous providers.
- Strategy changes alter the overlay on the next successful reconciliation.
