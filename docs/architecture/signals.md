# Signal propagation

Signals are the provider load a site observes, such as queue depth and KV-cache
pressure. `signalTransport` on the `GridNetwork` selects, grid-wide, how they
cross sites. It names the dissemination path, not the transport: SWIM membership
runs either way and only where the load signal travels changes, which is why the
modes are `gossip` and `poll` rather than `swim`.

  P[Provider metrics] --> M{signalTransport.mode}
  M -->|gossip| G[Local scrape and scoring] --> C[SWIM and CRDT overlay] --> O[Routing overlay]
  M -->|poll| S[Serve /v1/site/signals over mTLS] --> D[Peers pull, scoring off] --> O
```

```yaml
signalTransport:
  mode: poll
```

`gossip` is the established path: each site scrapes and scores locally and the
samples ride the SWIM and CRDT overlay. `poll` instead serves the scraped
signals on a mutual-TLS `/v1/site/signals` endpoint, polls peers, and turns
local scoring off so the gateway ranks from what it pulls. A peer's poll URL is
its SWIM-advertised host at the signals port, so a reachable member is a
reachable signals endpoint.

The field is optional. Absent, the grid gossips, so existing deployments are
unaffected. The mode is read once at operator start, so changing it is a
restart, not a live flip, which keeps the mTLS listener bound only under `poll`.
When a `GridNetwork` declares another mode than the running one, for example
one created after the operator started, the operator exits so Kubernetes
restarts it into the declared mode. Only the poll path restarts on a peer trust
change, so a trust change under `gossip` does not restart it. Certificate rotation
reads the declared trust on every check, so under `gossip` a switch to `pin` stops
it without a restart. Under `poll` the same change restarts the operator.

At Tech Preview one operator serves one `GridNetwork`, and it fails to start on
more than one rather than pick a mode for the process-global serve and poll
paths. A reader treats a missing signal as neutral, not zero, per the signal
mapping reference.
