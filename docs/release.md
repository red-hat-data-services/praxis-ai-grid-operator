# Release Process

## Versioning

AI Grid Network (AGN) uses [Semantic Versioning][semver]. The workspace version is defined in
`workspace.package.version` in the root `Cargo.toml`. Workspace crates inherit
that version.

The five charts published by this release (`grid-operator`, `grid-site`,
`praxis-gateway`, `grid-mock-providers`, and `grid-enrollment`) have versions
matching the AGN release. The `appVersion` for AGN-owned workloads in the
release charts also matches the AGN tag. The `praxis-gateway` chart is
different: its `appVersion` identifies the default Praxis AI image and may
advance independently of AGN.

`grid-enrollment` joined the release line in 0.2.0. Before that it versioned
independently and its image was published elsewhere, so a reader installing
from chart defaults could not pull it.

The project-owned `grid-gateway` operand is versioned with AGN and must be
built from the same tagged AGN source. It is distinct from the separately
released Praxis AI image used by the `praxis-gateway` chart.

[semver]: https://semver.org/

## Release Artifacts

An AGN release publishes:

- `ghcr.io/praxis-proxy/grid-gateway:v<version>`;
- `ghcr.io/praxis-proxy/grid-operator`;
- `ghcr.io/praxis-proxy/grid-mock-providers`;
- `ghcr.io/praxis-proxy/grid-overlay-sync`;
- `ghcr.io/praxis-proxy/grid-enrollment`;
- the `grid-operator`, `grid-site`, `praxis-gateway`,
  `grid-mock-providers`, and `grid-enrollment` Helm charts; and
- a GitHub Release containing generated notes and immutable artifact digests.

Build `grid-gateway:v<version>` from the matching AGN release tag and record
its immutable digest in the release manifest. Image publication does not depend
on a chart or operator consuming the image.

The `praxis-gateway` chart uses the separately released
`ghcr.io/praxis-proxy/ai:<tag>` image. Qualify any chart or operator that
consumes `grid-gateway` separately, as described below.

AGN does not publish a Praxis AI image or an AI rollup. The release workflow
verifies the pinned official Praxis AI image used by the `praxis-gateway` chart,
including its digest and OCI provenance.

Optional Praxis AI filters are an explicit deployment dependency. Examples or
qualifications that require optional filters must document the required Cargo
features and require the caller to provide a compatible image. They must not
silently substitute a custom-built Praxis AI image.

## Pre-release Checklist

Before opening a release preparation pull request:

- [ ] Update the workspace version in `Cargo.toml` and regenerate `Cargo.lock`.
- [ ] Update the five release-chart versions listed above.
- [ ] Update their AGN workload `appVersion` values to the AGN tag.
- [ ] Verify the `praxis-gateway` `appVersion` and default image match the
      intended official Praxis AI release.
- [ ] Bump every chart value that pins an AGN image tag explicitly, such as
      `praxis-gateway` `overlay.sidecar.image.tag`. An empty tag there resolves
      to the chart `appVersion`, which is the Praxis AI version, so these are
      pinned by hand and the release workflow does not check them.
- [ ] Confirm the release workflow builds
      `ghcr.io/praxis-proxy/grid-gateway:v<version>` from the same tagged AGN
      source, publishes the version tag, and records the resulting immutable
      digest.
- [ ] Update the release workflow's pinned AI tag, digest, and source revision
      when the default Praxis AI image changes.
- [ ] Run `cargo +nightly-2026-03-28 fmt --all -- --check`.
- [ ] Run `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.
- [ ] Run `make test`, `make doc`, and `make lint`.
- [ ] Run `git diff --check` and validate the release workflow with
      `actionlint`.
- [ ] Lint and render the five release charts with their required values.
- [ ] Validate affected Forge topologies.
- [ ] Run the relevant integration qualifications when routing, overlay, or
      gateway compatibility changes.
- [ ] Confirm generated evidence and local build artifacts are not committed.
- [ ] Review pull request labels so generated release notes are useful.

The first-class integration qualifications are documented in
[the documentation index](README.md#integration-qualifications). They build
isolated Kind environments, exercise runtime behavior, record evidence, and
clean up their resources.

## Integration qualification checklist

Run the individual qualification commands below against fresh source builds
and fresh, uniquely tagged images. There is deliberately no aggregate release
qualification command. Run the commands sequentially in a dedicated checkout:
several use shared Forge state, Kind cluster names, or Docker network names.
Until Forge teardown is run-scoped, a concurrent run using the same state
directory can lose its clusters even when it uses a different config file.

| Area | Command | Topology/config path | Classification | Required when | Feature docs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| Workload inference / no ingress | `cargo xtask env run-grid-glb-demo --forge-config tests/e2e/topologies/grid-glb-demo/forge.yaml --no-ingress --full --teardown --evidence-dir "$EVIDENCE_DIR"` | Reuses `tests/e2e/topologies/grid-glb-demo/forge.yaml`; documented by `tests/e2e/topologies/grid-workload-inference/README.md` | Release qualification | Workload inference, no-ingress routing, or cluster-local workload entry changes | [README](../tests/e2e/topologies/grid-workload-inference/README.md) |

Use the following one-line command stack after setting `IMAGE_TAG` and
`EVIDENCE_DIR` for each run. The quota qualification additionally requires a
Praxis AI image built with the optional features shown below; the other
topologies require the filters documented in their READMEs and may use the
official compatible AI image where applicable.

```console
cargo xtask env run-grid-provider-traffic-qualification --forge-config tests/e2e/topologies/grid-provider-traffic/forge.yaml --full --teardown --evidence-dir "$EVIDENCE_DIR"
GRID_XTASK_SIM_IMAGE=ghcr.io/llm-d/llm-d-inference-sim:v0.10.2 cargo xtask env run-grid-static-weighted-qualification --forge-config tests/e2e/topologies/grid-static-weighted/forge.yaml --quick --teardown --evidence-dir "$EVIDENCE_DIR"
cargo xtask env run-grid-token-rate-limit-qualification --forge-config tests/e2e/topologies/grid-token-rate-limit/forge.yaml --image-tag "$IMAGE_TAG" --evidence-dir "$EVIDENCE_DIR"
cargo xtask env run-grid-single-cluster-multi-gateway-qualification --forge-config tests/e2e/topologies/grid-single-cluster-multi-gateway/forge.yaml --evidence-dir "$EVIDENCE_DIR"
cargo xtask env run-grid-combined-site-demo --forge-config tests/e2e/topologies/grid-combined-site/forge.yaml --full --teardown --evidence-dir "$EVIDENCE_DIR"
cargo xtask env run-grid-glb-demo --forge-config tests/e2e/topologies/grid-glb-demo/forge.yaml --full --teardown --evidence-dir "$EVIDENCE_DIR"

cargo xtask env run-grid-llmd-pool-metrics-demo --forge-config tests/e2e/topologies/grid-llmd-pool-metrics/forge.yaml --full --teardown --evidence-dir "$EVIDENCE_DIR"
```

The checked-in Praxis configurations for these Kind qualifications explicitly
enable both `insecure_options.allow_private_endpoints` and
`insecure_options.allow_private_upstreams` because their test backends use
private Kind Service addresses and reserved cluster IPs. These are
qualification-only settings; production configurations retain the default
private-upstream rejection.

### Images and optional features

Each run must use exact image references that are materialized into the
resolved Forge configuration and loaded into Kind when `imagePullPolicy:
Never` is used. Record the image IDs or immutable digests in the evidence.
Typical local overrides are:

```console
export GRID_XTASK_GATEWAY_IMAGE=praxis-ai:$IMAGE_TAG
export GRID_XTASK_OPERATOR_IMAGE=grid-operator:$IMAGE_TAG
export GRID_XTASK_OVERLAY_SYNC_IMAGE=grid-overlay-sync:$IMAGE_TAG
export GRID_XTASK_MOCK_PROVIDER_IMAGE=grid-mock-providers:$IMAGE_TAG
export GRID_XTASK_SIM_IMAGE=ghcr.io/neuralmagic/vllm-vcr:vllm0.23
export GRID_XTASK_IMAGE_PULL_POLICY=Never
```

In the current qualification tooling, `GRID_XTASK_GATEWAY_IMAGE` names the
Praxis AI gateway image used by the fixtures. It does not refer to the
project-owned `grid-gateway` operand.

The distributed token-quota qualification requires the optional Praxis AI
`token-rate-limit-filter`. Praxis AI 0.4.0 already includes Basic Auth; a
custom quota image only needs to enable the token filter. The qualification's
image label still declares both available filters:

```text
token-rate-limit-filter,praxis-filter/basic-auth-filter
```

The image label and runtime registrations must match the compiled feature
set. The standard official AI image may be suitable for provider selection and
other gateway paths, but a quota run must be **BLOCKED**, never marked PASS, if
the required filters are absent or its feature label is unavailable or
inaccurate. See the [provider traffic README](../tests/e2e/topologies/grid-provider-traffic/README.md), [quota README](../tests/e2e/topologies/grid-token-rate-limit/README.md), and the other topology READMEs for exact image preparation.

### Evidence, cleanup, and release gates

Create a new UTC-stamped evidence directory for every run, normally beneath
`evidence/`. Evidence from an older commit, source tree, image tag, or image
digest is not valid for the current release. Generated evidence must not be
committed.

Use `--teardown` where the command accepts it; the quota and single-cluster
qualifications attempt cleanup by default unless `--keep` is set. SIGKILL can
stop either qualification before cleanup runs, and the quota runner's default
SIGINT path also skips its cleanup guard. Verify the actual cleanup results
and ownership before removing anything manually. A missing
prerequisite, unavailable image, missing Forge binary, or failed
readiness/convergence check is **BLOCKED** or **FAIL**, never PASS. Preserve
non-2xx responses and first failures in the evidence; do not hide them with
retries or reinterpret them as successful routing.

`cargo xtask env validate-all` is a separate legacy/local validation suite. It
does not run the release qualification matrix above and must not be presented
as a substitute for these topology-specific commands.

Experimental classification means that a topology is outside the default
supported release surface; it does not permit weakening assertions or ignoring
failed results. When an experimental path is changed or claimed in release
notes, run it and report its evidence independently.

### Qualification details

| Area | Behavior proved | Images and overrides | Evidence, runtime, and cleanup | Feature docs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Provider traffic selection and round-robin | Grid publishes stable provider candidates and groups; Praxis AI accepts the overlay and returns trusted attribution while eligible providers receive round-robin traffic. | Official compatible Praxis AI gateway image, plus locally built `grid-operator`, `grid-overlay-sync`, `grid-mock-providers`, and VCR images. Use the `GRID_XTASK_*_IMAGE` overrides above when validating unreleased Grid code. | Write to the run's UTC-stamped `EVIDENCE_DIR`; the full run is typically several minutes. Verify teardown against the run inventory. | [README](../tests/e2e/topologies/grid-provider-traffic/README.md) |
| Distributed token quota | Basic Auth precedes admission; Alice's sliding-window budget is shared across consumers; routing spans sites; concurrency, expiry, restart persistence, Valkey fail-closed behavior, recovery, and NetworkPolicy are exercised. | Praxis AI 0.4.0 includes Basic Auth; a custom quota image must enable `token-rate-limit-filter` and declare both available filters in its image label. Use `--image-tag` and the exact image required by the README. | Record structured quota and routing evidence under `EVIDENCE_DIR`; runtime is variable and materially longer than a smoke test. The command attempts cleanup on normal completion or handled failure; do not use `--keep` for release evidence. | [README](../tests/e2e/topologies/grid-token-rate-limit/README.md) |
| Single-cluster multi-gateway | Two consumer gateways independently accept and serve the same three-provider overlay inside one Kubernetes cluster and one GridSite; attributed round-robin selection, provider withdrawal/restoration, consumer failure/recovery, concurrent traffic, and NetworkPolicy boundaries are exercised. | The fixed `grid-operator:single-cluster-qualification`, `grid-overlay-sync:single-cluster-qualification`, and `praxis-ai:single-cluster-qualification` references are local-development defaults. Release validation should set `GRID_XTASK_OPERATOR_IMAGE`, `GRID_XTASK_OVERLAY_SYNC_IMAGE`, and `GRID_XTASK_GATEWAY_IMAGE` to unique references; set `GRID_XTASK_SIM_IMAGE` as needed. All resolved references are loaded into Kind under `imagePullPolicy: Never`. | The command records timestamped structured evidence and attempts cleanup unless `--keep` is explicitly supplied. It does not claim multi-site SWIM, WAN behavior, or a globally shared round-robin cursor. | [README](../tests/e2e/topologies/grid-single-cluster-multi-gateway/README.md) |
| Combined-site lifecycle | Combined-site bootstrap, trusted round-robin, provider drain and restoration, secondary add/remove/re-add, session fallback, revision convergence, and lifecycle cleanup. | Official compatible Praxis AI image plus local `grid-operator`, `grid-overlay-sync`, `grid-mock-providers`, and VCR images through the overrides above. | Save lifecycle timelines and request attribution under `EVIDENCE_DIR`; a full run is typically on the order of tens of minutes. Run alone and verify teardown against the run inventory. | [README](../tests/e2e/topologies/grid-combined-site/README.md) |
| GLB | Global load-balancing and network-boundary behavior, including provider attribution and the configured ingress path. | Official compatible Praxis AI image plus the topology's required local `grid-operator`, `grid-overlay-sync`, `grid-mock-providers`, and VCR images; use the listed overrides and `Never` pull policy for local images. | Save results under `EVIDENCE_DIR`; use `--quick` for bounded diagnostics or `--full` for qualification. Run alone and verify teardown against the run inventory. | [README](../tests/e2e/topologies/grid-glb-demo/README.md) |
| Workload inference / no ingress | Workload inference through the no-ingress path and its provider/network behavior. This reuses the GLB command with `--no-ingress`; it is not a separate invented CLI command. | Same image set and overrides as GLB, with any optional AI features required by that topology's README. | Save no-ingress evidence under `EVIDENCE_DIR`; use `--quick` for diagnostics or `--full` for qualification. Run alone and verify teardown against the run inventory. | [README](../tests/e2e/topologies/grid-workload-inference/README.md) |
| llm-d pool metrics pressure and recovery | Pool-metrics observation, pressure-aware placement, availability during transitions, and recovery after metrics return below threshold. | Official compatible Praxis AI image plus local `grid-operator`, `grid-overlay-sync`, and the llm-d/EPP images required by its README; `--metrics-mtls` and `--kv-cache` are optional command flags when the topology enables them. | Save metric, overlay, reload, request, and recovery timelines under `EVIDENCE_DIR`; runtime is variable and may be long. Run alone and verify teardown against the run inventory. | [README](../tests/e2e/topologies/grid-llmd-pool-metrics/README.md) |

## Tagging A Release

Tags use `v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>`. Create the tag only
from the reviewed commit after its pull request and CI checks pass. Sign the tag
using the project's normal Git signing configuration:

```console
VERSION="${VERSION:?set VERSION to the workspace release version}"
TAG="v${VERSION}"
git tag -s "$TAG" -m "AGN $TAG"
git push origin "$TAG"
```

Do not move or recreate a published release tag. Prepare a new patch release
for corrections.

## Automated Publication

Pushing a valid release tag triggers the **Release** workflow. The workflow:

1. verifies that the tag matches the workspace version;
2. reruns lint, tests, and documentation validation from the tagged source;
3. verifies the pinned official Praxis AI image and provenance;
4. builds and publishes the version-tagged AGN container images, including
   `grid-gateway`, with SBOM and provenance attestations;
5. validates, packages, and publishes the five release charts; and
6. creates the GitHub Release with generated notes and immutable digests.

The workflow can also be dispatched for an existing immutable release tag. A
manual dispatch does not replace the requirement for a reviewed, signed tag.

## Post-publication Verification

For every release:

- [ ] Confirm `ghcr.io/praxis-proxy/grid-gateway:v<version>` exists and its
      registry digest matches the digest recorded in the GitHub Release
      manifest.
- [ ] Confirm that deployments using the `praxis-gateway` chart still resolve
      the separately released `ghcr.io/praxis-proxy/ai:<tag>` image; that chart
      is not evidence that the `grid-gateway` operand is wired.

### `grid-gateway` consumer qualification

Before deploying the `grid-gateway` operand:

- [ ] Identify the intended chart or operator consumer and verify that its
      rendered image reference uses the release's `grid-gateway` image by its
      recorded immutable digest, or a version tag that resolves to that digest.
- [ ] Preserve the rendered consumer reference with the deployment evidence.

Until that consumer exists and passes this check, record `grid-gateway`
consumption as **NOT QUALIFIED**. This does not block publication of
`grid-gateway` or the other AGN release artifacts.

## Release Notes

AGN uses [GitHub Releases][releases] for release notes. There is no committed
version-specific changelog. Add the user-facing summary, compatibility notes,
upgrade considerations, qualification results, and demonstration links to the
GitHub Release page.

[releases]: https://github.com/praxis-proxy/grid/releases

## Release Branches

Release branches are optional. Create one from a release tag only when a
supported line needs a backport. Use `release/v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.x`, cherry-pick
the focused fix, and publish a new patch tag through the normal workflow.
