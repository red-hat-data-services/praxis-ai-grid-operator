//! Crypto backend seam: rcgen (default) or OpenSSL EVP (`fips`).
//!
//! The keygen/sign/verify primitive is chosen at compile time. `fips` routes
//! through OpenSSL EVP so a FIPS host enforces the validated module.
//!
//! The two backends are equivalent under this crate's verifier (signature,
//! issuer match, SPIFFE SAN, validity), not byte-for-byte: the extension sets
//! differ, so a persisted CA should be loaded by the backend that minted it.
