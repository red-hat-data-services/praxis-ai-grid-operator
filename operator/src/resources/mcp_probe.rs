//! Live MCP `tools/list` probe for `AgentToolProvider`.
//!
//! Adapts `praxis-ai`'s `mcp_client::list_tools()` pattern (an `rmcp`-based
//! Streamable HTTP transport, plus its SSRF/DNS-pinning protections) for use
//! as a controller-initiated discovery probe rather than a request-time proxy
//! call. `rmcp`'s transport already handles both MCP protocol generations
//! (legacy handshake-based and modern stateless) transparently, so none of
//! that detection logic is reimplemented here.
//!
//! Split into three layers, deliberately:
//!
//! - **Pure decision logic** (outcome classification, phase/reason mapping, discovered-tools preservation, tool-name
//!   extraction, header/TLS attachment decisions): unit-tested with hand-built fixtures, no network.
//! - **Mockable Kubernetes I/O** (`attach_tls_ca`/`attach_tls_client_identity`/`read_tls_material`'s
//!   `Api::<Secret>::get_opt` calls and PEM parsing): unit-tested against a `tower::service_fn`-backed `kube::Client`
//!   (see `mock_kube_client_with_secrets` in `mod tests`) — this is genuine Secret I/O, but deterministic and mockable
//!   without a real API server, so it stays at the unit tier rather than the integration tier below.
//! - **Real network I/O** (`rmcp`/`reqwest` error introspection, the actual live probe): covered by the integration
//!   tier against a real local HTTP listener (`mod integration_tests`), not unit-tested, since it exercises third-party
//!   wire behavior rather than this crate's own branching.
