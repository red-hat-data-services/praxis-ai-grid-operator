//! SWIM membership data model and status summarization.
//!
//! This module provides the pure, data-only representation of SWIM-based peer
//! discovery.  It holds no live networking handles, background tasks, or global
//! mutable state.  The live foca-backed UDP runtime lives in
//! [`crate::swim_runtime`] and produces [`MembershipSnapshot`] values consumed
//! by the [`GridNetwork`] controller.
//!
