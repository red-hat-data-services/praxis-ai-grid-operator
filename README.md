# AI Grid Network (AGN)

AI Grid Network (AGN) is a distributed control plane that connects AI
inference backends across Kubernetes clusters, cloud
providers, and third-party APIs into a single routable
mesh. AGN figures out where models are, which backends
are healthy, and which one should handle the next
request - then tells the [Praxis] gateway how to route.

## How It Works

The AGN Operator is an orchestrator, not a proxy. It watches
Kubernetes resources, discovers peer sites over a
gossip protocol (SWIM), propagates provider state
with CRDTs, scores candidates, and writes a routing
overlay that Praxis consumes at request time.

```

The gateways communicate over mTLS.

AGN Operators exchange membership and provider state over SWIM and CRDT
replication.

AGN handles the **control plane** (what should be
routable). Praxis handles the **data plane** (routing
and proxying actual requests).

## Key Concepts

**GridNetwork** - defines a logical mesh of sites.
Holds SWIM seeds, TLS settings, and gateway
references.

**GridSite** - represents one participating cluster
or location. Created automatically from SWIM
discovery or manually for seed peers.

**InferenceProvider** - declares model capacity at a
site: model name, backend kind (self-hosted,
cloud-managed, or API provider), health config, and
auth strategy.

**Routing overlay** - a versioned ConfigMap that AGN
writes for each gateway. Contains scored candidates,
cluster definitions with mTLS config, and credential
references. Praxis hot-reloads this without restarts.

**Scoring** - AGN applies one provider-level strategy before
writing the overlay. `noMetrics` is the generic default for
external APIs and providers without comparable telemetry.
llm-d pools can opt into `queueDepth` or `kvCachePressure`.
Request-specific prefix affinity remains inside llm-d EPP,
which selects a pod after AGN selects a provider pool.

See the [AGN Routing Guide](docs/routing.md) for configuration by routing
need, selection groups, request-time selection modes, affinity, and runnable
examples.

## Request Flow

Once the overlay is loaded, a request flows through
two gateway pipelines:

```text
client request
  -> Praxis consumer/edge gateway
  -> intelligent_route selects a provider from overlay
  -> gateway-to-gateway mTLS
  -> Praxis provider gateway authenticates the peer
  -> provider_route validates the selected candidate
  -> credential_inject adds backend auth
  -> load_balancer picks a backend instance
  -> response returns to the client
```

AGN is never in the request path. All routing
decisions use a pre-computed local overlay file.

## Install

```console
helm install grid-operator \
  oci://ghcr.io/praxis-proxy/charts/grid-operator \
  --version <version> \
  --namespace grid-system \
  --create-namespace
```

See the
[chart documentation](charts/grid-operator/README.md)
for values, RBAC, CRD upgrades, and SWIM service
exposure. Install a compatible
[Praxis](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/praxis)
gateway separately.

For Kustomize or raw manifests, see
[deploy/](deploy/README.md).

## Getting Started

[Praxis demos](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/demos): deployable demonstrations
with automated runtime
proofs of routing, failover, security boundaries,
and provider lifecycle.

[Existing-cluster installation](docs/installation/existing-clusters.md): install
AGN and Praxis on running Kubernetes clusters with Helm.

## Project name and compatibility

AI Grid Network (AGN) is the human-facing project name used in documentation.
Established software identifiers remain unchanged:
the Rust package and binary are `operator`, the deployed operator is
`grid-operator`, the operator chart is `grid-operator`, and the gateway chart is
`praxis-gateway`. The API group remains `grid.praxis-proxy.io`, with kinds such
as `GridNetwork` and `GridSite`; existing `grid-*` resource names, `GRID_*`
environment variables, labels, metrics, and configuration fields are unchanged.
Existing downstream names, including `praxis-ai-grid-operator` where used, are
also unchanged. Downstream naming alignment is deferred to a separate effort.

## Development

Requires Rust stable 1.96+, Rust nightly (for
rustfmt), and Docker/Podman + kind for integration
tests.

```console
make build          # workspace build
make test           # all tests
make lint           # clippy + fmt check + machete
make audit          # cargo audit + cargo deny check
make all            # build + fmt + lint + test + audit
```

[conventions](docs/conventions.md) for full details.
